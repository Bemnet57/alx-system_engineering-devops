# 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions

This project is part of the **ALX Back End ProDev program**. It explores how to use shell initialization files, manage variables, understand expansions, and perform shell arithmetic.

## üìö Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following:

- What happens when you type `$ ls -l *.txt` in the shell
- Shell expansions and their types
- Shell variables ‚Äì local vs global
- Shell arithmetic operations
- How to create, modify, and delete shell variables and aliases

## üìÅ Project Structure

Each file corresponds to a task that demonstrates a specific concept. All scripts are executable and written for the Bourne shell (`#!/bin/bash`).
